Hello! I am Ruyi Ding, a final year PhD student from Northeastern University, supervised by [Yunsi Fei](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/fei-yunsi/) in [NUEESS](http://nueess.coe.neu.edu/nueess/index.php/Main_Page)
My research covers the intersection of AI security and hardware security. I am particularly focused on *neural network model robustness, privacy, IP protection* and *side-channel analysis*. 

## About Me

The primary objective of my work is building machine-learning systems that are both secure and privacy-preserving; identifying and mitigating hardware side channels and micro-architectural vulnerabilities; employing machine learning-hardware co-design for security applications. My efforts aim to contribute significantly to **Responsible AI** and **Reliable Computer Systems**.

## Research Interests

- **AI security**: Exploring machine learning security and privacy issue during training, inference and deployment.
- **Hardware Security**: Security and Privacy of embedding DNNs.
- **Side-channel Analysis**: Power/EM side channel anaylsis and micro-architecture SCA.
- **Data Analysis**: Traffic data analysis and event detection.
